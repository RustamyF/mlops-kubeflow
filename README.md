# MLOps Platform with Kubeflow
Kubeflow is an end-to-end ML platform for Kubernetes and has components for each stage of the ML lifecycle.
Kubeflow is for data scientists in building and experimenting with ML pipelines and for ML engineers deploying
ML systems to various environments for developing, testing, and production-level serving.

## Installation of Kubeflow on AWS
Before anything else, we must ensure we have proper IAM access to create an EKS cluster. Follow this instruction
to create an IAM user if you don't have any, and use that to set up your credentials. It is recommended to use
AWS-CLI to configure AWS credentials. To set them up through the aws-cliÂ , install it first, then run aws configure
to configure the AWS-CLI and credentials:

```shell script
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]:
AWS Secret Access Key [None]:
Default region name [None]:
Default output format [None]:
```

After we get the proper IAM access to create an EKS cluster, installing Kubeflow to the cluster contains three steps:
1. Set up the development environment. We will use eksctl to deploy the EKS cluster using CLI, kubectl to communicate
 with the cluster, and Kustomize to apply Kubeflow manifests to the cluster.

 ```shell script
#! /bin/bash.

echo "***********************Install kubectl******************************"

sudo curl --silent --location -o /usr/local/bin/kubectl \
   https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.19.6/2021-01-05/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl

## 2. install eksctl
echo "***********************Lauch EKS cluster******************************"

curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp

sudo mv -v /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
eksctl version

## 3. install kustomize
echo "***********************Install kustomize ******************************"

curl --silent --location --remote-name \
"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/download/kustomize/v3.2.3/kustomize_kustomize.v3.2.3_linux_amd64" && \
chmod a+x kustomize_kustomize.v3.2.3_linux_amd64 && \
sudo mv kustomize_kustomize.v3.2.3_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kustomize
```

2. Once eksctl is installed, we can use the eksctl create cluster command to create a new EKS cluster.
 This command takes several arguments that allow you to specify the cluster's configuration, such as the
  number of worker nodes and the version of Kubernetes to use. We can also write the arguments in a configuration
   file to simplify the creation of the EKS cluster. Deploy an EKS cluster using eksctl with kubeflow.yml
   configuration file shown below.

 ```yaml
---
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: kubeflow
  region: us-east-1
  version: "1.19"

availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]

managedNodeGroups:
- name: nodegroup
  desiredCapacity: 5
  instanceType: m5.xlarge
  ssh:
    enableSsm: true

secretsEncryption:
  keyARN: <enter your secrete encryption key here>
```

Deploy the cluster using eksctl create cluster -f kubeflow.yaml command. It's important to note that creating an EKS
 cluster can take some time, as the worker nodes need to be provisioned, and the Kubernetes control plane needs to
 be set up. You can check the status of the cluster creation process by running the eksctl get clusters command.

To install Kubeflow, we must apply the manifests to the EKS cluster. We will use Kubeflow on AWS, which is an
open-source distribution of Kubeflow with AWS. Download Kubeflow manifests (Kubeflow v1.4.1, aws-b1.0.0) from
their GitHub using the following command.

```shell script
export KUBEFLOW_RELEASE_VERSION=v1.4.1
export AWS_RELEASE_VERSION=v1.4.1-aws-b1.0.0
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/kubeflow-manifests.git && cd kubeflow-manifests
git checkout ${AWS_RELEASE_VERSION}
git clone --branch ${KUBEFLOW_RELEASE_VERSION} https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests.git upstream
```

Install all Kubeflow official components (residing under apps) and all common services (residing under common)
using either Kustomize or Helm with a single command:

```shell script
while ! kustomize build docs/deployment/vanilla | kubectl apply -f -; do echo "Retrying to apply resources"; sleep 10; done
```

After the installation is completed, make sure all the components are installed by connecting to the cluster using the
 following eksctl commands:

 ```shell script
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
kubectl get pods -n istio-system
kubectl get pods -n auth
kubectl get pods -n knative-eventing
kubectl get pods -n knative-serving
kubectl get pods -n kubeflow
kubectl get pods -n kubeflow-user-example-com
```

Once the installation is complete, you can use it to connect to the Kubeflow cluster by running the following command:

```shell script
kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80
```
This will forward port 8080 on your local machine to the ingress gateway service on the Kubeflow cluster,
allowing you to access the Kubeflow web interface. To access the web interface, open a web browser and navigate to
 http://localhost:8080. This will open the Kubeflow dashboard, as shown in Figure xx. Kubeflow uses Dex as a login
  service, and the default user and password information are  email: user@example.com, password: 12341234
